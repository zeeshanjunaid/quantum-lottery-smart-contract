## Quantum Lottery â€” Smart Contracts (Foundry)

![CI](https://github.com/zeeshanjunaid/quantum-lottery-smart-contract/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

Modular, gas-aware lottery contracts with Chainlink VRF, chunked processing, Q-score streaks, and refund safety. Built with Foundry, OpenZeppelin, and Chainlink VRF v2.

### Highlights
- Thin wrapper `QuantumLottery.sol` with `QuantumLotteryBase.sol` implementation for clean codegen and coverage
- Concern-specific libraries to keep functions small, testable, and gas-efficient
- Chainlink VRF v2 integration and chunked post-fulfillment processing to avoid block gas limits
- Two ticket types (Standard/Quantum), Q-score streak system, and a "cosmic surge" multiplier window
- Safe refund flow for force-resolved draws and guarded withdrawal of unclaimed refunds

## Architecture

- `src/QuantumLottery.sol`: Thin wrapper that inherits `QuantumLotteryBase` and forwards constructor args
- `src/QuantumLotteryBase.sol`: Core implementation, events, and external/public API
- `src/QuantumLotteryTypes.sol`: Enums, structs, events, and constants
- Libraries (separation of concerns):
	- `QuantumLotteryProcessor.sol`: draw processing, winner updates, payouts
	- `QuantumLotteryFulfillment.sol`: randomness fulfillment + total Q-score calc
	- `QuantumLotteryEntry.sol`: ticket purchase and accounting
	- `QuantumLotteryCleanup.sol`: storage cleanup in chunks
	- `QuantumLotteryRefunds.sol`: CEI-compliant refund logic
	- `QuantumLotteryWithdraw.sol`: compute and zero unclaimed refunds
	- `QuantumLotteryForceResolve.sol`: forceful resolution if VRF stalls
	- `QuantumLotteryHelpers.sol`: Q-score increase helper

Core dependencies:
- Solidity ^0.8.20
- OpenZeppelin (Ownable v5, ReentrancyGuard, IERC20, SafeERC20, Math)
- Chainlink VRF v2 (coordinator + consumer base)

## Key constants (see `QuantumLotteryTypes.sol`)
- Standard ticket: `STANDARD_TICKET_PRICE = 10_000_000` (10 USDC, 6 decimals)
- Quantum ticket: `QUANTUM_TICKET_PRICE = 30_000_000` (30 USDC)
- Winner payout percent: `WINNER_PAYOUT_PERCENT = 92` (treasury fee 8%)
- Max Q-score: `MAX_QSCORE = 100_000`
- Seconds per hour: `SECONDS_PER_HOUR = 3600`
- VRF gas limit: `CALLBACK_GAS_LIMIT = 2_500_000`

## Draw lifecycle
1) OPEN: Users call `buyTicket(ticketType)` to join the current hour's draw
2) CALCULATING_WINNER: Owner calls `requestRandomWinner(hourId)` for a past hour; VRF request sent
3) RESOLVING: On VRF callback, randomness is recorded; chunked processing is required to finish
4) RESOLVED: After `processDrawChunk(hourId, iterations)` completes, payouts are done and `cleanupPending = true`
5) Cleanup: Call `cleanupDrawChunk(hourId, iterations)` until it completes to clear per-draw mappings

Why chunks? Large draws can't do all work in a single transaction (block gas limits). We split winner selection and per-player updates across multiple calls.

## Refunds and force-resolve

If a draw gets stuck in CALCULATING_WINNER or RESOLVING for longer than `MAX_WAIT_HOURS = 24`, the owner can call `forceResolveDraw(hourId)` to:
1) Cancel any pending VRF request for that draw
2) Mark the draw as RESOLVED with a dummy winner
3) Allow normal processing and payout to continue

Refunds are only possible for force-resolved draws. Users can call `refundTicket(hourId, ticketId)` to get back their ticket price in USDC.

Unclaimed refunds can be withdrawn by the owner via `withdrawUnclaimedRefunds()` after a grace period. This is guarded to prevent reentrancy and accounting errors.

## Security Information

We take security seriously. If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, please:

1. Do not open a public issue.
2. Email the maintainer privately: security@invalid.example
3. Provide details and steps to reproduce.

We will triage and respond as soon as possible.

### Security Fixes Applied

All critical and medium security issues have been resolved:

#### Critical Issues Fixed

1. âœ… Missing Ownership Functionality - CRITICAL
   - Issue: The contract used `onlyOwner` modifier but didn't inherit from `Ownable`
   - Impact: All admin functions would fail at runtime
   - Fix: Leveraged the existing ownership functionality from Chainlink's VRF contract

2. âœ… Integer Overflow Protection in Q-Score Calculation
   - Issue: Potential overflow in Q-score addition before min operation
   - Impact: Could cause transaction reversion or unexpected behavior
   - Fix: Added overflow protection with unchecked block and explicit overflow detection

3. âœ… Inconsistent Streak Threshold Logic
   - Issue: Different threshold values used in different places (6/11 vs 5/10)
   - Impact: Inconsistent bonus calculations
   - Fix: Aligned all thresholds to use constants (5 and 10)

#### Medium Issues Fixed

4. âœ… Enhanced Error Handling Consistency
   - Issue: Mixed use of `require()` and custom errors
   - Impact: Inconsistent gas costs and error reporting
   - Fix: Added new custom errors and converted string-based reverts

## Workflow Guide

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
# Use the VS Code task or run manually:
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:DeployScript --rpc-url "$RPC_URL" --private-key "$PRIVATE_KEY" --broadcast
forge script script/SetupVRF.s.sol:SetupVRF --rpc-url "$RPC_URL" --private-key "$PRIVATE_KEY" --broadcast
```

This automatically:
- Builds and deploys the lottery contract
- Creates a new VRF subscription
- Funds it with 0.1 LINK
- Adds the lottery as a consumer
- Updates your `.env` file

### 2. Populate Lottery
```bash
# Populate with 20 participants (7 Quantum, 13 Standard)
JOIN_COUNT=20 QUANTUM_COUNT=7 forge script script/MultiJoin.s.sol:MultiJoin --rpc-url "$RPC_URL" --private-key "$PRIVATE_KEY" --broadcast
```

### 3. Wait for Hour End

After the hour ends, the draw automatically transitions to CALCULATING_WINNER state.

### 4. Request Winner
```bash
# From the hour's end timestamp, get the hourId and request a winner
cast send "$LOTTERY" "requestRandomWinner(uint32)" 1712880000 --rpc-url "$RPC_URL" --private-key "$PRIVATE_KEY"
```

### 5. Process Draw (after VRF callback)
```bash
# Process in chunks until complete (watch for "DrawFullyProcessed" event)
cast send "$LOTTERY" "processDrawChunk(uint32,uint8)" 1712880000 5 --rpc-url "$RPC_URL" --private-key "$PRIVATE_KEY"
```

### 6. Cleanup Storage
```bash
# After processing, clean up storage in chunks (watch for "DrawFullyCleaned" event)
cast send "$LOTTERY" "cleanupDrawChunk(uint32,uint8)" 1712880000 5 --rpc-url "$RPC_URL" --private-key "$PRIVATE_KEY"
```
